Dear editors:

     Attached is our manuscript titled "An experimental study of
exhaustive solutions for the Mastermind puzzle" to be considered for
publication in your journal. The main reason for this submission to
your journal is the prior publication of an article related to the
topic of Mastermind, "Efficient solutions for Mastermind using genetic
algorithms" by Berghman, Goossens and Leus; this last one has been
suggested as a reviewer.

	A draft for this paper has been published also in ArXiV
http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.1315. Please note that there are several
major (material added) and minor (corrections) with this submission.

      Yours,

Merelo, Mora, Cotta, Runarsson
